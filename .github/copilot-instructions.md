# AI agent instructions (Claude Skills Manager)

This repository deploys **native GitHub Copilot instructions** under `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.
When you work on files matching a skill's `applyTo` globs, follow that skill's instruction file fully.

## Installed skills

| Skill | Applies when |
|---|---|
| adx-schema-check | `**/*.kql, **/adx/**, **/*kusto*, **/adx-schema*` — Cross-check KQL/Kusto queries in application code against the canonical ADX (Azure Data Explorer) table/column schema definitions, and optionally against the live cluster. Flags table/column name mismatches before they cause runtime query failures. Use when working on ADX/Kusto-backed API routes, debugging "table not found"/"column not found" errors, or after changing the schema. |
| doc-coauthoring | `**/*.md, **/docs/**` — Guide users through a structured workflow for co-authoring documentation. Use when user wants to write documentation, proposals, technical specs, decision docs, or similar structured content. This workflow helps users efficiently transfer context, refine content through iteration, and verify the doc works for readers. Trigger when user mentions writing docs, creating proposals, drafting specs, or similar documentation tasks. |
| file-style-conventions | `**/*` — Apply two lightweight file-hygiene conventions when writing or editing files - no emoji characters outside Markdown (.md) files, and YAML files (.yml/.yaml) end with exactly one trailing newline. Use whenever creating or editing non-Markdown files that might contain emoji, or any .yml/.yaml file. |
| github-actions-ci | `**/.github/workflows/*.yml, **/.github/workflows/*.yaml, **/.github/**/*.md, **/test/**, **/src/**, **/*.test.ts, **/*.test.js` — Debug GitHub Actions pipeline failures and reproduce CI stages locally. Use when asked to debug CI, fix a failing workflow, reproduce a job with act, or run a pre-flight check before pushing. |
| self-learning | `**/*` — Maintain a project-local self-learning base of task/command outcomes — record successes and failures with timestamps, durations, and fixes; generate a patterns report (pass rates, recurring errors, known fixes); and surface a learned hint before retrying something that failed before. Use at the start of a session to check learned hints, after running a non-trivial command/skill to record the outcome, when asked "what failed before" or "what did we learn", or to record a manual decision/learning. |
| skill-creator | `**/*` — Create new skills, modify and improve existing skills, and measure skill performance. Use when users want to create a skill from scratch, edit, or optimize an existing skill, run evals to test a skill, benchmark skill performance with variance analysis, or optimize a skill's description for better triggering accuracy. |
| skill-feedback-adaptation | `**/.claude/learning/skill-feedback.jsonl, **/.claude/learning/task-skill-proposals.json, **/.claude/learning/**` — AUTO-START on new agent session/window (injected by profile-init-watch for Claude, Cursor, Kiro, Copilot) and on new tasks — analyze the prompt and repo, write task-skill-proposals.json, then read top proposed skills before other work. Also register user disagreement into skill-feedback.jsonl when the user says no, not, wrong, stop, or disagrees with agent output. |
| skill-official-updater | `**/*` — At the start of a new session, do a cheap check for new or updated official Anthropic skills (github.com/anthropics/skills) and automatically add or update them in skills_library/ (no user prompt). Also use on explicit request ("check for official skill updates", "sync official skills"). |
| skill-usage-insights | `**/.claude/learning/runs.jsonl, **/.claude/skills/**` — Analyze recorded skill usage in this project (.claude/learning/runs.jsonl, written by self-learning) and the skills installed in .claude/skills/ to produce a usage and KPI report - which skills are actively used and reliable, which are failing, and which are unused or low-value, with recommendations on what to add or remove. Use when asked for "skill usage stats", "skill KPIs", "which skills should we add or remove", or "are our installed skills still useful". |

## How to use in agent mode

1. Prefer instructions whose `applyTo` matches the files you are editing.
2. If multiple match, combine them; if they conflict, ask the user.
3. Do not invent procedures — use the installed `.instructions.md` files.
4. Claude Code skills live under `.claude/skills/`; Copilot uses this folder.
